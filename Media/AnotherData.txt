How To Make a Living Without a Job
The only way to make a living without a job is to generate passive income. You can’t just charge everything to a credit card.

Passive income is money you generate without having to work for it consistently. It typically involves making an upfront investment of time or labor.

For example, you might buy a rental property. After that initial investment, you should continue to produce income on a steady basis, enabling you to take a hands-off approach and focus on other things.

Let’s take a look at some of the more popular ways to live without a traditional job:

Open a High Yield Savings Account,
Invest in the Stock Market,
Freelancing,
Pet Sitting,
Make Rental Income,
Travel Blogging,
Sell Media Assets,
Rent Your Car on Turo,
Earn a Pension,
Become a Landlord.

Good Luck!!!!
