How running can support your wellbeing
In recent years, the importance of mental health, as well as physical health, has been thrown into sharp relief – and one bright light that continues to guide people through testing times is running.

Get a natural high
After and during exercise our bodies release endorphins and endocannabinoids, both of which have long been associated with the well-known concept of ‘runner’s high’.

Boost your self-esteem
We spoke to wellbeing and performance specialist Chevy Rough about how exercise can make you feel better about yourself.

“Training for a marathon – or any running event – can do wonders for your confidence, across all aspects of your life. Quickly, you find yourself wondering what else you could do if you put your mind and body to it. Along the way, of course, you may question your ability – for example, when an unfinished training run or injury knocks your self-esteem. No-one deserves to feel this way.
